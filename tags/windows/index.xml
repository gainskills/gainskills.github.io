E.g.: In drive: C:
|- test | |- test.xt os.path.join
import os fullpath = os.path.join(&amp;#39;c:&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;test.txt&amp;#39;) Output on windows:
c:test\test.txt Output on Mac OS c:/test/test.txt
os.sep.join
import os fullpath = os.sep.join([&amp;#39;c:&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;test&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;test.txt&amp;#39;]) Output on windows:
c:\test\test.txt Output on Mac OS c:/test/test.txt
From the outputs, you can see the difference: os.path.join() doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as expected on windows.</description></item><item><title>File name on windows</title><link>https://blog.gainskills.top/2019/03/01/file-name-on-winos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gainskills.top/2019/03/01/file-name-on-winos/</guid><description>Error 1 Run a bat (ping.bat) to ping multiple IPs like this: set testipa=x.x.x.x echo Checking ping %testipa% (15 times), please don&amp;#39;t close current window echo ping %testipa% (15 times) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; test.log ping %testipa% -w 500 -n 15 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; test.log

I will show how to check the sessions of ‘Microsoft OneNote’.
Windows Microsoft provides its own product for packets capturing: Microsoft Network Monitor.
Lunch ‘Microsoft Network Monitor’ before you run OneNote:

Here is a topology about the environment for performance testing, let’s name the servers 1st:
1 windows server as the License/Workspace server 5 windows servers as the Network Server 5 windows servers as the Automation server Topo It took us a lot of time to deploy the product and collect logs on all of these servers.
My colleague wrote a client-server application and do some of the tasks automatically.</description></item><item><title>VSphere6, VCenter6 Installation</title><link>https://blog.gainskills.top/2016/01/08/vsphere6-vcenter6-installation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gainskills.top/2016/01/08/vsphere6-vcenter6-installation/</guid><description>Crash happened when I install Vsphere on my PC
