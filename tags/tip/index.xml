Different ways to use curl to post a file to a web server with samples (from both client-side and server: Python-Flask side) will be discussed because it took me a while on the server-side to receiving the data from client.
I would like to add samples of Python-requests, Postman later.

Here is a topology about the environment for performance testing, let‚Äôs name the servers 1st:
1 windows server as the License/Workspace server 5 windows servers as the Network Server 5 windows servers as the Automation server Topo It took us a lot of time to deploy the product and collect logs on all of these servers.
My colleague wrote a client-server application and do some of the tasks automatically. The application indeed works for log collection, but for product deployment, as the server end running as a service and fails to launch the InstallShield wizard, it doesn‚Äôt support the product installation.</description></item><item><title>Loop a dict to update the keys</title><link>https://blog.gainskills.top/2016/07/21/loop-a-dict-to-update-key/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gainskills.top/2016/07/21/loop-a-dict-to-update-key/</guid><description>Source dict:

The the SNMP Simulator software is intended for testing SNMP Managers against a large number of SNMP Agents that represent a potentially very large network populated with different kinds of SNMP-capable devices.
Refers to its project page for more info.
Why?
With SNMP simulator you can simulate a device by the output of SNMPwalk without considering MIB files.
