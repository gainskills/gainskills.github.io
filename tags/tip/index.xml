The SNMP Simulator software is intended for testing SNMP Managers against a large number of SNMP Agents that represent a potentially very large network populated with different kinds of SNMP-capable devices.
Refers to its project page for more info.
Why?
With SNMP simulator you can simulate a device by the output of SNMPwalk without consider MIB files.
This article is about how to install SNMP Simulator.
