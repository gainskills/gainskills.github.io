Different ways to use curl to post a file to a web server with samples (from both client side and server: Python-Flask side) will be discussed because it took me a while on server side to receiving the data from client.

The SNMP Simulator software is intended for testing SNMP Managers against a large number of SNMP Agents that represent a potentially very large network populated with different kinds of SNMP-capable devices.
Refers to its project page for more info.
Why?
With SNMP simulator you can simulate a device by the output of SNMPwalk without consider MIB files.
This article is about how to install SNMP Simulator.
