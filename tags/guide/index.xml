Here is a topology about the environment for performance testing, let’s name the servers 1st:
1 windows server as the License/Workspace server 5 windows servers as the Network Server 5 windows servers as the Automation server Topo It took us a lot of time to deploy the product and collect logs on all of these servers.
My colleague wrote a client-server application and do some of the tasks automatically. The application indeed works for log collection, but for product deployment, as the server end running as a service and fails to launch the InstallShield wizard, it doesn’t support the product installation.</description></item></channel></rss>
