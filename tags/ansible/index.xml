ansible_connnection should be ‘netconf’ Be careful on the netconf port, it should be 22 if you enable netconf over SSH (the default port is 830) PlayBook:

For SSH access, we should consider 3 methods:
Username/password Username/Public-Key without password Username/Public-Key with password Same EVE lab as the Telnet one: The Cisco IOS Router-192.168.1.99 is for SSH
Topo Enable SSH on the router Jump #1 username/password part to public key configuration, I discussed how to configure public key on IOS router with Putty before, instead of windows/putty, openssh is useful for generating keys on MAC OS.</description></item><item><title>Ansible-Access Network via Telnet</title><link>https://blog.gainskills.top/2018/09/04/ansible-access-network-via-telnet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gainskills.top/2018/09/04/ansible-access-network-via-telnet/</guid><description>I’m learning Ansible by reading the official document and some books like Ansible入门.

Here is a topology about the environment for performance testing, let’s name the servers 1st:
1 windows server as the License/Workspace server 5 windows servers as the Network Server 5 windows servers as the Automation server Topo It took us a lot of time to deploy the product and collect logs on all of these servers.
My colleague wrote a client-server application and do some of the tasks automatically. The application indeed works for log collection, but for product deployment, as the server end running as a service and fails to launch the InstallShield wizard, it doesn’t support the product installation.</description></item></channel></rss>
