My choice is Tinypng because it supports variety formats and its API.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://blog.gainskills.top/2019/01/01/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gainskills.top/2019/01/01/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello World!
